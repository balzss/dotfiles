## balzss' dotfiles
- This repo is the collection of my dotfiles
- Please do not use them without reading through each of them
- If you decide to try it out, run these commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/balzss/dotfiles $HOME/
    sh $HOME/dotfiles/push_dots.sh # *WARNING* this will erease all your existing dotfiles. Please do a backup before
    ```
- After that everything should be up and running
- If you want to backup your dotfiles, change the remote in your _$HOME/dotfiles_ directory
- Any idea or suggestion is welcomed
