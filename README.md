## balzss' dotfiles
- This repo is the collection of my dotfiles
- Please do not use them without reading through each of them
- If you decide to try it out, run these commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    !download the dotfiles
    wget https://github.com/balzss/dotfiles/archive/master.zip ; unzip master.zip ; rm master.zip

    !create the symlinks
    cd dotfiles-master
    ./install.sh
    ```
- After that everything should be up and running
- If you want to backup your dotfiles, change the remote in your _$HOME/dotfiles_ directory
- Any idea or suggestion is welcomed
